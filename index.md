As a postdoctoral associate in Prof. Kerri Cahoy's [STAR Lab](http://starlab.mit.edu), part of  MIT's Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, I am working on the DeMi CubeSat and the WFIRST CGI. 

My [graduate work](https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/19717 "PhD Dissertation PDF") in astronomy at Boston University focused on integrating,  relaunching, and understanding the <a title="PICTURE-B" href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/picture-b-seeing-through-the-glare"> PICTURE-B sounding rocket</a>  mission which demonstrated active wavefront sensing in space - an essential technology for stabilizing space telescope optics enough to sense reflected light from exoplanets against the billion times brighter signal from their host stars.

Other projects I have contributed to:

- building the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6352489">Dual-Wavelength Echidna Lidar </a>(DWEL),
- testing the detectors for the <a href="http://people.bu.edu/danowski/IMAGER/">Interstellar Medium Absorption Gradient Experiment Rocket </a>(IMAGER), 
- and inferring the density of the terrestrial ionosphere using observations from the  <a href="https://raids.nrl.navy.mil/">RAIDS</a>
(the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System) extreme ultraviolet spectrograph on on the International Space Station.

Before graduate school, I worked at <a href="http://www.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/">LIGO Hanford Observatory</a>.

Many summers, I have a blast teaching the talented students at <a href="http://www.astronomycamp.org">Astronomy Camp</a>.

I am committed to enabling access to research tools through using open source programming languages and contributing to open source scientific libraries. Please find examples such as the POPPY PSF library on my GitHub profile. My scientific publications are listed on my Google Scholar Profile or the ADS:
